        <p> Dmitri Shostakovich was born in 1906 in St. Petersburg, Russia. At the time, Russia was still under the rule
          of the House of Romanov (the last imperial dynasty of Russia). At the time of Dmitri's birth, the political
          rumblings of the Bolshevik Revolution had already begun. Rampant poverty and hunger were a way of life in
          1900s Russia. By age 11, Shostakovich was living under Soviet Russia's firm hand. By the time he entered
          Petrograd Conservatory in 1919, the political landscape of Russia (U.S.S.R.) was fully shaping and influencing
          his musical career.

            <p>A poly-stylist, Shostakovich developed a hybrid voice, combining a variety of different musical techniques into his music. Shostakovich’s music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the grotesque, and ambivalent tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style pioneered by Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the post-Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler. </p>

            <h4 id="section4" class="text-center h1">Personality</h4>
            <p>Shostakovich was a very nervous person. He was shy and very self-critical. He hated having to talk to people he did not know. He did not sit still, always fidgeting and twitching his face nervously. He was, however, always very polite and very kind to everyone he met. He was very careful not to criticize musicians who asked him for advice. He said very little, but what he said was carefully thought out. He wrote lots of letters to the authorities to try to help his friends. He was very reliable, and always tried to arrive on time. In his last years, he found it very difficult to use his hands because of his illness, but he always insisted on writing down his music himself.</p>
